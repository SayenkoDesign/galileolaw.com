<h2 class="text-center">We Represent People in Need, not Claim Numbers</h2>


We chose Galileo as our firm's namesake because our values match his.  The astronomer and mathematician was the father of modern science.  We owe every scientific understanding of our natural world and our place in the
universe directly or indirectly to Galileo.  He resisted dogma to rigorously investigate the truth.  He had the integrity to spend the last 20 years of his life in prison standing up for his beliefs.

<br><br>
<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#bc7543; font-size:18px;">Our firm shares Galileo’s visionary spirit:</h3>We don’t subscribe to conventional wisdom that our clients’ cases fit into one “box” or another.  We explore their experience to present the authentic truth of all their claims to insurance companies and, if necessary, to juries.<br><br>

<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#bc7543; font-size:18px;">Our firm shares Galileo’s integrity:</h3>
We will not compromise our values, our clients’ values, our ethical standards, or our commitment to service.<br><br>

<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase; color:#bc7543; font-size:18px;">We are a revolution in trial practice:</h3>Our model of client service, diversity of expertise, creativity, and integrity sets new standards for a premier personal injury law firm.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Industry Recognition</h2>
Attorney Paul Veillon began his insurance career at Safeco, so he understands “the system” from the inside. He quickly learned that helping people in need, not fighting them, was worth coming to work every day, a reward in itself. For over a decade he has prevailed in and out of Court, through jury trials and before the Supreme Court of Washington, fighting for catastrophic injury victims and vehicle owners who suffered diminished value. The Washington State Association for Justice has recognized him as a leader in the Plaintiffs’ bar: he served from 2014-2015 on the Trial News Editorial Board and currently serves as the Vice-chair of its Insurance Law Section and on the CLE Committee responsible for teaching other lawyers how to best help injury and insurance bad faith victims.

Paul is a excellent attorney in every respect. Like most lawyers, he understands the legal system and the relevant law in the areas that he
specializes in. Unlike most attorneys, Paul will focus on what your case means to you rather than what it means to him or his firm. This means that he'll provide 100% honest and straightforward information and advice to you. It also means he will fight for you just as aggressively as you would fight for yourself.

Paul is a top quality attorney because he consistently produces top quality work. Anything Paul works on is done with precision and care. He also has a great command of the law, in particular the civil rules of procedure. Any client of his can be confident they will get a true professional.

I tried a worksite injury case against Paul several years ago. At every phase of discovery and throughout trial, Paul was professional, courteous and a very skilled advocate for his client. I remember his closing argument to the jury was especially powerful and I have no doubt it played a large role in getting the jury to award as much as they did. I would highly recommend Paul to anyone who has been injured."</i></h3>
